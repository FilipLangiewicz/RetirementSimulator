# Retirement Simulator 🧮💬  

**Retirement Simulator** is an application where you can *“play through”* your entire professional life on a timeline – from age 18 all the way to retirement.  
You decide when you work, what kind of contract you have, when you take breaks, or when you start your own business.  
The program shows how these decisions affect your future pension.  

You don’t just get a single number. You can chat with a **chatbot** that evaluates your choices, points out mistakes, and suggests what could lead to a better outcome.  
It’s a bit like talking to a retirement advisor – only more direct and visual.

## 🚀 How It Works  

- You have access to a **career timeline** – from age 18 to 80.  
- You mark what you do during those years: work full-time, run a business, take a break, or choose less favorable contracts.  
- The simulator calculates how much money you’ll accumulate in the pension system, taking into account **account and sub-account indexation** and current system rules.  
- The **chatbot** comments on your decisions – it tells you which were beneficial, which reduced your pension, and suggests alternatives.

## 🎯 Why We’re Building This  

We want to show that your work choices truly matter.  

- **Freelance contract for many years?** → almost no contributions.  
- **B2B without extra savings?** → good take-home pay now, but very low pension later.  
- **Working a few years longer?** → a real difference in benefit amount.  

The simulator teaches through experience – you can see what happens to your pension depending on which path you choose today.
